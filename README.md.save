Create new user account on login
-----------------------------------

For this to happen you must change the "is_synchronised_with_external" function at
https://github.com/danielneis/moodle-auth_ws/blob/master/auth.php#L134 to return true.

Then you must implement the "get_userinfo" function at https://github.com/danielneis/moodle-auth_ws/blob/master/auth.php#L88 to return the information for the user. See the fields on user table that Moodle may use to check if user is confirmed/complete.
